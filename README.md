# scnsrc_scraper
Pulls the latest bluray [1080p] movies and throws them in the db.  

I have found scnsrc.me to be the most reliable site for u2d bluray releases without poluting xXx content and other crap.  I have wrote this for people that want to create automation scripts based off of new releases from scnsrc (bluray 1080p, you can change the code to support what you need). 

## Next Steps (Im not adding)
If you have a torrent program, you can hook into this program [after it succesffully writes to the db] to have it auto download for you.  Hooking in at this point will allow you to only grab a single copy of the movie.
